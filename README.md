# A demo of a Javascript demonstration Mongoose OS app

## Overview

This is the demo I gave at the Christchruch Robotics club on 18th December 2017

## How to install this app

- Install and start [mos tool](https://mongoose-os.com/software.html)
- Switch to the Project page, find and import an existing app, for example 'demo-js', this will create the necessary directories
- outisde of the 'mos' tool, change to the 'apps-1.xx' directory created in the step above and clone the demo using 'git clone https://github.com/g8ecj/esp32_demo.git' (or whatever your favourite git syntax is)
- Back in the Project page, select the new app and build and flash it to your esp32 board (which you have plugged into a USB port!!)
