# A blank Mongoose OS app

## Overview

This is the demo I gave at the Christchruch Robotics club on 18th December 2017

## How to install this app

- Install and start [mos tool](https://mongoose-os.com/software.html)
- Switch to the Project page, find and import an existing app, for example 'demo-js', this will create the necessary directories
- 'cd apps-1.xx' into the directory created in the step above and clone the demo using 'git clone https://github.com/g8ecj/esp32_demo.git'
- start the mongoose app 'mos' and use the browser page it opens to select and build the demo and flash it to your esp32 board (which you have plugged into a USB port!!)
